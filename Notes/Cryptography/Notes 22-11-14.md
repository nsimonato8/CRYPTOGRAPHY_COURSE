Cost of $O(N \cdot log^{A}(N))$, for some $A > 0$.
## Erastostene's sieve
Cost of $O(N \cdot lg(N) lg(lg(N)))$ b.o. .
 * Define a list of numbers of length $N$.
 * Look for the first number prime number and delete its multiples.
 * Repeat until there are no more composite numbers.
 * What remains is the list of prime number up to $N$.
 * Since this algorithm needs $O(N)$ memory, some improvements can be made:
     * Instead of memorizing $N$ numbers, we can memorize $N$ bits, that we set as $1$ iff the number in that position is prime, otherwise $0$.
 * Trivial implementation of the algorithm:
     * Input: $N \in \mathbb{Z}$
     * Complexity: 



## Notes
Vinogradov's theorem: Every number is the sum of three prime numbers
