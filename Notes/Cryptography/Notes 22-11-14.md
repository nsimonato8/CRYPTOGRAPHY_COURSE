## Erastostene's sieve
Cost of $O(N \cdot lg(N) lg(lg(N)))$ b.o. .
 * Define a list of numbers of length $N$.
 * Look for the first number prime number and delete its multiples.
 * Repeat until there are no more composite numbers.
 * What remains is the list of prime number up to $N$.
 * Since this algorithm needs $O(N)$ memory, some improvements can be made:
     * Instead of memorizing $N$ numbers, we can memorize $N$ bits, that we set as $1$ iff the number in that position is prime, otherwise $0$.
 * Trivial implementation of the algorithm:
     * Input: $N \in \mathbb{Z}$
     * Complexity:
         * Number of steps of the main loop: $O(\sqrt{N})$
         * Cost of the first inner loop: $log^{2}(p)$
         * Cost of the second inner loop: $\sum_{k=1}^{l_{p}} log(p^{2} + k_{p})$
### F. Mertens upper bound
$\sum_{p \leq N^{1/2}} \frac{1}{p} \leq C_{1} log(log(N))$, where $p$ are the prime numbers up to $\sqrt{N}$.

### Theorem: **Partial Summation Formula**
Let $a(n)$ be a complex sequence $\mathbb{f}: [1, +\infty] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ such that $\mathbb{f} \in \mathbb{C}^{1}$. Then:
\[
\sum_{n \leq X} a(n)f(n) = A(x)f(x) - A(1)f(1) -  \int_{1}^{x} A(t)f(t) dt \text{ , where } A(x) = \sum_{n \leq t} a(n)
\]

Let's consider
\[
a(n) = \{1 \text{ if } n \text{ is prime}, 0 \text{ otherwise}\}
\]

Consider $f(t) = \frac{1}{t}$.
Then,
\[
\sum_{p \leq X} \frac{1}{p} = \sum_{n \leq X} a(n)f(n) = \frac{\Pi(X)}{X} - 0 + \int_{2}^{x} \frac{\Pi(X)}{t^{2}}dt
\]
Then,
\[
A(X) = \sum_{n \leq X} a(n) = \sum_{p \leq X} 1 = \Pi(X)
\]

## Trial division method
Brute force on the non trivial divisors of $N$.

Cost of $O(log^{A+2}(N))$, for some $A > 0$. The worst case is $O(T \cdot log^{2}(N))$, where $T$ is the number of loops executed.

This can also be used as a primality algorithm, but it's inefficient.

## Fermat Factoring Method
Find $x,y$ such that $N = x^2 - y^2 = pq = (x-y)(x+y)$

## Notes
**Vinogradov's theorem**: Every number is the sum of three prime numbers.
